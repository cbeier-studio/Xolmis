# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **Xolmis**, please help us keep the community safe by following these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
   Security issues must be reported privately to avoid exploitation before a fix is released.

2. **Contact the maintainers directly:**
   - Email: `hello@christianbeier.studio`
   - Alternatively, use GitHub’s [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability?versionId=free-pro-team%40latest&productId=code-security&restPage=security-advisories%2Cworking-with-repository-security-advisories%2Ccreating-a-repository-security-advisory#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

3. **Provide details:**
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact and affected modules.
   - Suggested mitigation if available.

We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**, investigate the issue, and provide updates on progress. Once resolved, we will publish a security advisory and release a patched version.

## Security Best Practices

- Always use the latest supported version.
- Keep your database backups secure and encrypted.
