# Xolmis

A free, open source, multi-platform ornithological data manager, built using Lazarus/FPC.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Xolmis is in the early stages of development and is subject to some breaking changes. As soon as possible, a stable version will be made available to anyone who intends to use the app in production.

Xolmis is an ornithological data management system intended for researchers and birdwatchers. It was designed to aggregate separated data files (_e.g._ CSV files and Excel spreadsheets), which may end up being lost over time. In addition to the objective of aggregating different types of data collected in research and observations, it also aims to facilitate the curation, crossing and sharing of data, while increasing its consistency and security.
