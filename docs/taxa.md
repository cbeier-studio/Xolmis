# Taxa

A taxon is a name within a taxonomic rank (category) and it follows a hierarchy. The ornithological taxa can be viewed, but not edited. The Taxa module offers charts and reports related to each taxon. Open the Taxa module in the main menu **Taxonomy â†’ Taxa**.

To display the taxa you need to run a search. The search box is on the top left of the module and have an options button. You can set to _Show only the recorded taxa_ or not.

!!! info

    The taxonomy adopted in Xolmis is the [Clements Checklist](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/), which is used by [eBird](https://www.ebird.org/) and we wanted to maintain compatibility. The [AviList](https://www.avilist.org/) unified taxonomy will be eventually integrated in Clements Checklist, so we do not have plans of changing to it in the near future.

## Taxon information

With a taxon selected, it displays the taxon information, which includes: scientific name, authority, taxonomic rank, IUCN Red List category, english name, spanish name, portuguese name, geographical distribution, taxonomic hierarchy, synonyms, and subordinate taxa. It also show links to the modules with taxon records, displaying the number of records on each. Click on a module name to go to that module and display the records of the selected taxon.

## Searching a taxon in the Web

With a taxon selected, you can search it on a website using the buttons of the right toolbar. Currently, it supports searches on [Google Search](https://www.google.com), [Google Images](https://www.google.com/images), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [Birds of the World](https://birdsoftheworld.org), [eBird](https://ebird.org), [Wikiaves](https://www.wikiaves.com.br), [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org), and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org). It opens the search in the default internet browser.
