# User interface

The Xolmis interface is designed to support different **user experiences**. Instead of learning each button in isolation, think of the interface as a set of areas that guide you through the main tasks: navigating, working with records, exploring relationships, and accessing complementary tools.

## Navigation

This is how you move around the system and find what you need.

- **Main menu**: The top bar organizes modules by theme (File, Sampling, Individuals, Breeding, Management, Geo, Taxonomy, Help).  
- **Navigation bar**: Just below the menu, with quick access buttons (*Home* :material-home:, *New* :material-plus-circle:), tabs for open modules, search box :octicons-search-16:, and notifications :material-bell:.  

Use these tools to **switch modules quickly**, **open new records**, and **search across datasets**.

## Working with records

This is where you spend most of your time: viewing, editing, and managing data.

- **Main records panel**: The grid that displays records, similar to a spreadsheet.  
- **Main records toolbar**: Actions like *New record* :material-plus-circle:, *Quick Entry* :material-table-large-plus:, *Edit* :material-pencil:, *Mark/unmark all records* :material-checkbox-multiple-marked:, *Export* :material-share:, *Print* :material-printer:, *Clear all filters* :material-filter-remove:, *Delete* :material-delete:.  
- **Main records status bar**: Shows how many records match your query, lets you navigate (*First* :material-page-first:, *Previous* :material-chevron-left:, *Next* :material-chevron-right:, *Last* :material-page-last:), refresh records :material-refresh:, open [record history](record-history.md) :material-history:, and show [record verification](record-verifications.md) :material-checkbox-multiple-marked-circle:.  

Together, these controls let you **add, edit, filter, and export records** efficiently.

## Exploring relationships

Many records are connected — specimens to surveys, eggs to nests, captures to individuals.

- **Related records panel**: Expandable area at the bottom of the window.  
- **Navigation bar**: Tabs to switch between related modules.  
- **Toolbar**: Quick Entry, batch additions, quick add/edit, export, delete.  
- **Status bar**: Similar to the main grid, showing record counts and navigation.  
- **Side panel (when available)**: Extra context, e.g., project budget balance.  

This panel helps you **see connections** and **manage linked data** without leaving the main record.

## Complementary tools

On the right side, the **side toolbar** opens panels that enrich your work:

- **Details**: Full record fields.  
- **[Quick filters](search-and-filtering-data.md#quick-filters)**: Apply or clear filters.  
- **[Images](images.md), [audio](audio-recordings.md), [video](videos.md)**: Manage multimedia files.  
- **[Documents and links](documents.md)**: Attach references.  
- **[Map](map.md)**: Visualize coordinates.  
- **[Summary](summary.md)**: Quick counts or averages.  
- **Columns**: Customize visible fields and grid layout.
    - The side panel lists all available columns for the current module’s grid.
    - Each column can be toggled **visible/invisible** using the checkboxes.
    - The order of the columns in the list defines their order in the grid.
    - Adjusting row height and column width helps optimize the display depending on the type of data (e.g., short codes vs. long notes).
- **Recycle bin**: Manage deleted records.
    - Restore selected :material-delete-restore: - Restores the selected record (reactivates record).
    - Delete permanently :material-delete-forever: - Delete the selected record from the database permanently.

Each panel has its own mini-toolbar (e.g., view images, clear filters, restore records).

## System feedback

At the very bottom, the **main status bar** shows:

- Current database connection
- Active user
- Temporary messages
- Next backup
- Enter as Tab status
- System log status
- Application version

This area keeps you informed about your environment and system state.
