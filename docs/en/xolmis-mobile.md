# Xolmis Mobile

**[Xolmis Mobile](https://github.com/cbeier-studio/xolmis_mobile)** is the field companion to Xolmis Desktop. It is designed to make ornithological data collection faster and easier during expeditions, surveys, and opportunistic observations. While the Desktop version focuses on **data management, analysis, and reporting**, the Mobile app is optimized for **real-time data entry in the field**.
