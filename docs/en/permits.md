# Permits

In many research projects, **permits** are a recurring bureaucratic requirement. A permit represents an official authorization that allows researchers to carry out specific activities, such as bird banding, specimen collection, field surveys, or transportation of biological material. Managing permits properly ensures compliance with legal regulations and institutional policies, and helps maintain transparency in research activities.

Open the Permits module in the main menu: **Management → Permits**.

## Adding or editing a permit

When creating or editing a permit record, the following fields are available:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | Yes | Short name to identify the permit |
| **Permit number** |  | Official number of the permit document |
| **Type** | Yes | Type of permit: Banding permit, Collection permit, Research permit, Entrance permit, Transport permit, Other permit |
| **Dispatcher** | Yes | Institution or organization that issued the permit |
| **Dispatch date** | Yes | Date when the permit was issued |
| **Expire date** |  | Date when the permit will expire (if applicable) |
| **Notes** |  | Any additional information about the permit |

## Best practices

- **Keep permits updated**: Always record the expiration date and renew permits before they expire.  
- **Link permits to projects**: Associate permits with the relevant research projects to ensure traceability.  
- **Record issuing institutions**: Document the dispatcher clearly to facilitate audits and compliance checks.  
- **Use notes for details**: Add information such as restrictions, conditions, or geographic scope of the permit.  
- **Centralize management**: Store all permits in Xolmis to avoid losing track of documents across different teams.  

## Relation to other modules

Permits are interconnected with other parts of Xolmis:

- **[Projects](projects.md)**: Permits are often required to authorize project activities.  
- **[Researchers](researchers.md)**: Individual researchers may need specific permits to conduct fieldwork.  
- **[Captures](captures.md) and [Specimens](specimens.md)**: Banding, specimen collection, and sampling activities must be linked to valid permits.  

By managing permits in Xolmis, you ensure that all research activities are legally authorized, properly documented, and easily accessible for reporting or auditing.
