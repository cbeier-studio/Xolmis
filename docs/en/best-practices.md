# Best practices

The **Best practices** section provides recommendations to ensure efficient, consistent, and reliable use of Xolmis Desktop.

## Data entry

- **Use clear names and codes**: Field numbers, abbreviations, and identifiers should be unique and descriptive.  
- **Record precise coordinates**: Always double-check longitude and latitude order.  
- **Link related records**: Connect specimens to individuals, nests, or eggs for better traceability.  

## Data management

- **Avoid duplication**: Check if a record already exists before creating a new one.  
- **Use categories consistently**: Group methods, specimens, and records logically.  
- **Document context**: Add notes for unusual conditions, adaptations, or special circumstances.  

## Backup and security

- **Schedule backups**: Configure automatic backups (daily or weekly) and store them in a cloud drive.  
- **Verify backups**: Periodically check that backup files are complete and accessible.  
- **Manage permissions**: Assign user roles carefully to protect sensitive data.  

## Workflow efficiency

- **Learn keyboard shortcuts**: Use shortcuts for faster navigation and data entry.  
- **Customize grids and filters**: Adapt the interface to highlight the most relevant information.  
- **Use Quick Entry**: Add multiple records efficiently during fieldwork digitization.  

## Collaboration

- **Standardize methods**: Ensure all team members use the same sampling methods for comparability.  
- **Share feedback**: Encourage users to report issues or suggest improvements.  
- **Integrate with external platforms**: Use eBird or other exports to share data broadly.
