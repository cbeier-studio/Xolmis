# Record history

The **Record history** module provides a **read-only log** of all changes made to a record. It is an essential tool for **auditing, traceability, and accountability**, ensuring that every modification can be tracked over time. Users cannot edit the history directly — it is automatically generated by the system whenever a record is created, modified, deleted, or restored.

## Fields

Each entry in the record history contains the following information:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Date** | Date and time of the event |
| **Action** | Type of action performed (see details below) |
| **Property** | Field or property that was edited |
| **Old value** | Value of the property before editing |
| **New value** | Value of the property after editing |
| **Notes** | Additional information about the event (optional) |
| **Username** | User who performed the action |

## Actions

The following actions are tracked in the record history:

- **Insert** – A new record was created.  
- **Edit** – An existing record was modified.  
- **Delete** – A record was removed (sent to the recycle bin).  
- **Restore** – A previously deleted record was restored.  

## Best practices

- **Review history before editing**: Check past changes to understand the context of a record.  
- **Audit regularly**: Periodically review histories to ensure data integrity and compliance.  
- **Leverage usernames**: Track who made changes for accountability in collaborative environments.  
- **Restore carefully**: Use the restore action only when you are certain the record should be reactivated.  

By maintaining a detailed record history, Xolmis ensures **data reliability and transparency**, supporting both scientific research and administrative management.
