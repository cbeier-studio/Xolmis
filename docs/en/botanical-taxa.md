# Botanical taxa

The **Botanical taxa** module is used to register and manage plant taxa that are relevant to ornithological research. Plants play a fundamental role in bird ecology, serving as nesting substrates, food sources, or habitat components. By documenting botanical taxa, Xolmis allows researchers to link plant species to nests, habitats, and ecological interactions.

Open the Botanical taxa module in the main menu: **Taxonomy → Botanical taxa**.

## Adding or editing a botanical taxon

When creating or editing a botanical taxon record, the following fields are available:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scientific name** | Yes | The scientific name of the taxon (e.g., *Mimosa bimucronata*) |
| **Authorship** |  | Citation of the authorship of the scientific name (e.g., "Kuntze") |
| **Taxonomic rank** | Yes | The taxonomic rank of the taxon (species, genus, family, etc.) |
| **Vernacular name** |  | Any vernacular or popular names for the taxon (e.g., "maricá") |
| **Parent taxon** |  | Higher-rank taxon to which the record is linked (e.g., genus for a species) |
| **Valid name** |  | Valid taxon name selected if the taxon is considered a synonym |

## Best practices

- **Use accepted scientific names**: Always follow recognized botanical nomenclature to ensure consistency.  
- **Include authorship**: Helps distinguish between homonyms and clarify taxonomic authority.  
- **Record vernacular names**: Useful for field teams and local collaborators who may not use scientific names.  
- **Link to parent taxa**: Maintain the hierarchical structure (species → genus → family → order).  
- **Handle synonyms carefully**: Use the "Valid name" field to avoid duplication and ensure proper taxonomic alignment.  

## Relation to other modules

Botanical taxa are interconnected with several parts of Xolmis:

- **[Nests](nests.md)** – Plants are often used as nest supports; linking taxa provides ecological context.

By managing botanical taxa in Xolmis, researchers ensure that plant-related data is standardized, traceable, and integrated into ornithological studies.

## Example workflow

1. Register a plant species (*Mimosa bimucronata*) in the Botanical taxa module.  
2. Link it as the **support plant** for a nest record.  
3. Use vernacular names ("maricá") to facilitate communication with field assistants.  
4. Generate reports that summarize nest substrates by plant species.  

This workflow highlights how botanical taxa enrich ecological datasets and strengthen the connection between birds and their habitats.
