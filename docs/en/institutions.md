# Institutions

The **Institutions** module is used to register and manage organizations that are relevant to ornithological research and conservation. An institution can be a **university, NGO, research center, government agency, enterprise, or any other type of entity** involved in projects, permits, or collaborations. By documenting institutions, Xolmis ensures that all records are properly linked to their organizational context, strengthening accountability and collaboration.

Open the Institutions module in the main menu: **Management → Institutions**.

## Adding or editing an institution

When creating or editing an institution record, the following fields are available:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | Yes | Full official name of the institution |
| **Abbreviation** | Yes | Common abbreviation or acronym used for the institution |
| **Postal code** |  | CEP (Brazil), ZIP Code (USA), or equivalent |
| **Address** |  | Postal address of the institution |
| **Address detail** |  | Complementary details such as building, floor, or apartment number |
| **Neighborhood** |  | City subdivision or district |
| **Municipality** |  | County, city, village, or equivalent |
| **State** |  | State or province of the country |

| **E-mail** |  | Email address of the institution or contact person |

## Best practices

- **Use official names and abbreviations**: Ensure clarity and avoid duplication.  
- **Keep contact information updated**: Institutions often change emails or phone numbers; update records regularly.  
- **Document organizational hierarchy**: Use address details, municipality, and state fields to maintain precise location data.  
- **Add notes for context**: Record information such as research areas, conservation programs, or collaborations.  

## Relation to other modules

Institutions are interconnected with several parts of Xolmis:

- **[Researchers](researchers.md)** – Each researcher can be affiliated with one or more institutions.  
- **[Project members](projects.md#project-members)** – Projects are often coordinated and executed by researchers linked to institutions.  
- **[Permits](permits.md)** – Permits are issued by institutions or government agencies.  

By managing institutions in Xolmis, researchers ensure that organizational data is **standardized, traceable, and integrated** into ornithological records.
