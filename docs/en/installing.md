## First steps

When you open Xolmis for the first time after installation, or if no database connections are found, a **welcome dialog** will appear. This dialog guides you through the essential steps required to set up your Xolmis environment:

1. **Create a new database or open an existing one**  
      - You can start fresh with a new database or connect to an existing dataset.  
      - Databases are the core of Xolmis, storing all ornithological records, projects, and metadata.  

2. **Set media location**  
      - Define the folder where photos, audio recordings, and other media files will be stored.  
      - This ensures that all media linked to individuals, captures, and surveys is organized and accessible.  

3. **Set backup location and period**  
      - Choose a secure location for backups (external drive, cloud folder, etc.).  
      - Define the frequency of backups to protect against data loss.  

After creating a database, additional steps are required to populate it with core data. See [Starting a new database](first-steps.md) for guidance on adding gazetteer entries, sampling plots, institutions, and researchers.

## Best practices

- **Keep installers updated**: Always download the latest release to benefit from bug fixes and new features.  
- **Plan your database location**: Store databases in a secure and backed-up folder.  
- **Configure backups early**: Set up automatic backups to avoid losing valuable data.  
- **Organize media files**: Use a dedicated folder for photos, audio, and other media to simplify management.  
- **Check system requirements**: Ensure your computer meets the minimum requirements for smooth performance.  

By following the installation and setup process carefully, you ensure that Xolmis is ready to serve as a reliable and secure ornithological data repository.
