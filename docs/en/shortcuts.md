# Keyboard shortcuts

Xolmis includes a set of **keyboard shortcuts** that make navigation and data entry faster and more efficient. Using shortcuts reduces reliance on the mouse, speeds up repetitive tasks, and helps maintain focus during field data digitization or large dataset management.

## Global shortcuts

These shortcuts are available across the entire application, regardless of the module you are working in:

| Shortcut | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| ++ctrl+alt+o++ | Connect to a database |
| ++ctrl+alt+s++ | Open settings |
| ++ctrl+period++ | Switch to the next open tab |
| ++ctrl+comma++ | Switch to the previous open tab |
| ++f1++ | Open contextual help |
| ++ctrl+i++ | Open import wizard |
| ++ctrl+m++ | Open import from Xolmis Mobile dialog |
| | Import from eBird Records file |
| | Import geographical coordinates |

## Module shortcuts

These shortcuts apply to actions within modules (e.g., Captures, Sightings, Nests, Projects):

| Shortcut | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| ++f5++ | Refresh records |
| ++ctrl+n++ | Create a new record |
| ++ctrl+q++ | Open Quick Entry |
| ++ctrl+b++ | Create new batch of records (if available) |
| ++ctrl+e++ | Edit the selected record |
| ++ctrl+del++ | Delete the selected record |
| ++ctrl+f++ | Find/search records |
| ++ctrl+shift+f++ | Advanced filtering options |
| ++esc++ | Clear search |
| ++ctrl+alt+p++ | Open print preview |
| ++ctrl+alt+e++ | Export current grid or report |
| | Export coordinates of selected record (if available) |
| ++ctrl+alt+m++ | Open map view (if available) |
| ++ctrl+alt+l++ | Open summary panel (if available) |
| ++ctrl+alt+i++ | Open images side panel (if available) |
| ++ctrl+alt+a++ | Open audio recordings side panel (if available) |
| ++ctrl+alt+v++ | Open videos side panel (if available) |
| ++ctrl+alt+d++ | Open documents and links side panel (if available) |
| ++ctrl+alt+r++ | Open record verifications |
| ++ctrl+j++ | Show/hide the related data panel (if available) |
| | Create a new related record |
| | Edit the selected related record |
| | Delete the selected related record |
| | Adjust data grid columns to their contents |
| ++ctrl+equal++ | Increase row height of data grid |
| ++ctrl+minus++ | Decrease row height of data grid |
| ++ctrl+shift+t++ | Transfer bands (in Bands module) |
| ++ctrl+shift+b++ | Open bands balance (in Bands module) |

## Adding and editing data

These shortcuts are useful when inserting or editing records in dialogs:

| Shortcut | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| ++ctrl+s++ | Save the current record |
| ++esc++ | Cancel insert/edit and close the dialog |
| ++tab++/++enter++ | Move to the next field |
| ++shift+tab++ | Move to the previous field |

## Coodinates converter

| ++ctrl+o++ | Open from file |
| ++ctrl+s++ | Save to file |
| ++ctrl+enter++ | Convert coordinates |

!!! tip
    Enable the option **Use <Enter/Return> keys to jump to the next control** in [Settings](settings.md) to use ++enter++ as the ++tab++ key.

## Best practices

- **Memorize the most common shortcuts**: shortcuts used frequently during data entry.  
- **Use global shortcuts for quick access**: they save time when switching databases, adjusting settings, or navigating tabs.  
- **Combine with navigation keys**: Use ++tab++/++enter++ and ++shift+tab++ to move between fields while editing.  
- **Avoid accidental deletions**: Be cautious with ++ctrl+del++; confirm before deleting important records.  
- **Use media shortcuts**: Quickly open side panels for images, audio, or videos without leaving the record.  
- **Practice workflows**: Incorporate shortcuts into your daily routine to improve efficiency.  

## Relation to other modules

Keyboard shortcuts enhance productivity across all modules:

- **Captures and Sightings** – Quickly add or edit records during data digitization.  
- **Nests and Eggs** – Speed up repetitive entry of breeding data.  
- **Projects and Permits** – Simplify administrative record management.  
- **Institutions and Researchers** – Facilitate updates to collaborator information.  
- **Geo modules** – Access maps and summaries faster with dedicated shortcuts.  
- **Media modules** – Attach and manage multimedia files more efficiently.  

By mastering keyboard shortcuts, researchers can streamline their workflow in Xolmis, making data management **faster, more consistent, and less error-prone**.
