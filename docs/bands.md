# Bands (Rings)

The bands (or bird rings) are a method to identify individual birds. Each band is engraved with a unique identifier code. Xolmis is prepared to work with the Brazilian National Banding System (SNA - Sistema Nacional de Anilhamento), where each band is engraved with the size code (a letter) and a unique number for that size.

!!! note

    We have plans to include other banding systems, thus we need contributors familiarized with these systems. Contact us if you are interested in contributing.

## New batch

This dialog allows you to add bands in batches that share common data such as size, type, source, etc. Every number from the Start number to the Final number will be added as an individual band record.

## Band history

The band history dialog displays the transactions for a specific band, which include ordering, receiving, transferring, using, and reporting losses.

## Bands balance

The display indicates the quantity of bands you possess for each size, as well as the average number of bands utilized per day of banding and the highest number used in a single day. These figures help predict when to reorder bands, highlighting the row in yellow, or indicate when all bands of a particular size have been used, by turning the row red.
