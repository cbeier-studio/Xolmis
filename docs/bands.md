# Bands (Rings)

The bands (or bird rings) are a method to identify individual birds. Each band is engraved with a unique identifier code. Xolmis is prepared to work with the Brazilian National Banding System (SNA - Sistema Nacional de Anilhamento), where each band is engraved with the size code (a letter) and a unique number for that size.

!!! note

    We have plans to include other banding systems, thus we need contributors familiarized with these systems. Contact us if you are interested in contributing.

Open the Bands module in the main menu **Individuals â†’ Bands**.
