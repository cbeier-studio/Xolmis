# Gazetteer

A gazetteer is a catalog of toponyms or known site names. Toponyms are used in many modules of Xolmis and, once they were added to the Gazetteer, they can be searched and selected to fill other modules. Open the Gazetteer in the main menu **Geo â†’ Gazetteer**.

The toponyms follow a hierarchy, defined by the type of toponym and the parent toponym:

> - Country
    - State
        - Region
            - Municipality
                - District
                    - Locality

!!! info "Site hierarchy"

    The site hierarchy is used to display site names grouped like a tree, as in [Quick filters](search-and-filtering-data.md#quick-filters). Thus is important to assign the correct **Parent toponym** for each toponym.
