# Eggs

The **Eggs** module is used to record detailed information about bird eggs. It allows researchers to document measurements, morphology, coloration, and hatching outcomes, providing valuable data for studies on breeding biology, reproductive success, and species-specific traits.

Open the Eggs module in the main menu: **Breeding → Eggs**. Alternatively, eggs can be viewed grouped by nest in the **[Nests](nests.md)** module.

## Adding or editing an egg record

When creating or editing an egg record, the following fields are available:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nest** |  | Nest to which the egg is linked |
| **Field number** |  | Identifier of the egg or nest (used in field notes) |
| **Egg number** | Yes | Sequential number of the egg within the nest |
| **Measurement date** |  | Date when the egg was measured |
| **Taxon** | Yes | Taxon of the egg (species or subspecies) |
| **Observer** | Yes | Person who measured or recorded the egg |
| **Shape** |  | Shape of the egg (see details below) |
| **Phase** |  | Developmental phase of the egg (e.g., fresh, incubated, hatched) |
| **Eggshell color** |  | Dominant color of the eggshell |
| **Eggshell pattern** |  | Pattern of eggshell coloration (see details below) |
| **Eggshell texture** |  | Texture of the eggshell surface (see details below) |
| **Width** |  | Largest width of the egg, in millimeters |
| **Length** |  | Length of the egg, in millimeters |
| **Mass** |  | Mass of the egg, in grams |
| **Volume** |  | Estimated volume of the egg, in mm³ (calculated automatically from measurements) |
| **Hatched** |  | Check if the egg successfully hatched |
| **Individual hatched** |  | Individual bird that hatched from the egg (linked to Individuals module) |
| **Notes** |  | Any additional information about the egg |

## Egg shapes

Egg shape is an important morphological trait, often related to nesting environment and species adaptation. Available options:

- **Spherical** – Nearly round eggs.  
- **Elliptical** – Symmetrical oval shape.  
- **Oval** – Slightly elongated oval.  
- **Pyriform** – Pear-shaped, broader at one end.  
- **Conical** – Cone-shaped.  
- **Biconical** – Tapered at both ends.  
- **Cylindrical** – Tube-like shape.  
- **Longitudinal** – Elongated along one axis.  
- **Unknown** – Shape not determined.  

## Eggshell patterns

Eggshell patterns provide information about camouflage and species-specific traits. Available options:

- **Spots** – Small, distinct markings.  
- **Blotches** – Larger irregular patches.  
- **Squiggles** – Irregular wavy lines.  
- **Streaks** – Linear markings.  
- **Scrawls** – Random irregular marks.  
- **Spots and squiggles** – Combination of small spots and wavy lines.  
- **Blotches and squiggles** – Combination of blotches and wavy lines.  
- **Unknown** – Pattern not determined.  

## Eggshell textures

Eggshell texture can vary between species and may influence protection and gas exchange. Available options:

- **Chalky** – Powdery or matte surface.  
- **Shiny** – Reflective surface.  
- **Glossy** – Smooth and polished appearance.  
- **Pitted** – Surface with small depressions.  
- **Unknown** – Texture not determined.  

## Best practices

- **Record measurements carefully**: Use calipers and precision scales to ensure accuracy.  
- **Note developmental phase**: Helps track incubation progress and hatching success.  
- **Document eggshell traits**: Color, pattern, and texture are important for species identification and ecological studies.  
- **Link eggs to nests and individuals**: Ensures traceability across breeding records.  
- **Add notes for unusual cases**: Record abnormalities, damage, or parasitism.  

## Relation to other modules

The Eggs module is interconnected with other parts of Xolmis:

- **[Nests](nests.md)** – Eggs are grouped by nest, linking reproductive data to nest characteristics.  
- **[Individuals](individuals.md)** – Hatched eggs can be linked to specific individuals for long-term monitoring.  

By managing eggs in Xolmis, researchers build a detailed dataset on reproductive biology, enabling comparative studies across species, habitats, and time.
