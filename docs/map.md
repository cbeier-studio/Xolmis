# Map

Some modules have geographical coordinates in their records, as longitude and latitude. Those coordinates can be viewed on a map, to better understand the exact location of the record. For this, open the map clicking in the map icon :material-map: of the right toolbar of the module.

The map can be zoomed in and out using the scroll wheel of the mouse, and panned clicking, holding and moving the mouse.

Generally, only one red dot is shown, representing the coordinates of the current record. For surveys, however, if they have mist nets, it will show a red dot for the survey start coordinates, and yellow dots for each mist net coordinates.

## Exporting coordinates

At the top toolbar of the map, you can export a file with the coordinates being shown, clicking in the share :material-share: button. You can export in KML (default), KMZ, GPX and GeoJSON formats.
