# Print data

Most modules have a print button :material-printer: that opens a menu with options to generate printable reports.

## Print grid

The Print grid option generate a report with the exact same layout as the module data grid. Click on the print button :material-printer: at the module toolbar and select **Print grid**. It will open a preview window where you can send the report to the printer or save it to file.

!!! note

    You may notice that the preview window does not follow the same graphical patterns of other windows and modules of Xolmis. It is that way because we used a pre-made report tool. We plan to standardize the graphical interface of this option in the future.

A downside of this option is that, as many modules have quite a bit of columns, the same records can comprise various pages in the generated report. It could lead to a huge number of pages if there are a lot of records.

## Print preview

Other reports use the Xolmis' print preview window. You can zoom in or out and navigate through the pages, and that controls are in the bottom status bar of the window. At the top toolbar you can send the report to the printer, configure the printer and save the report as PDF.

### Send to printer

Click the **Print** button :material-printer: to send the report to the printer. It will open the print dialog, where you can set which printer you want to use, what pages to print, and the number of copies.

### Export PDF

Click the **Save PDF** button :fontawesome-regular-file-pdf: to export the report to a PDF file. It will open the save dialog, where you can set the folder and file name.
