    Before adding any recordings, go to [Settings](settings.md) in the Media section and set the video files location. The recordings added save the file path relative to this location. Changing the location afterwards can be problematic, at the moment. We are working on a solution.

## Adding videos

You can add videos clicking in the add button :material-plus-circle: at the toolbar of the videos side panel. Then select all the files that you want to attach to the current record and click **Open**. The progress of adding the recordings is shown. Some video files have metadata, that is used to get some info about the recording, such as date of creation. Other video info must be edited manually afterwards.

Alternatively, you can add videos simply dragging the files from a file explorer and dropping on the videos side panel.

## Editing video info

To edit the video info, click in the edit button :material-pencil: at the toolbar of the videos side panel.
