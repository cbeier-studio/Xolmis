# Expeditions

The **Expeditions** module is used to organize and document field trips carried out for ornithological research. An expedition represents a **defined period of fieldwork**, usually involving a team of researchers, specific goals, and a geographic area. By registering expeditions, you can group surveys, captures, and observations under a common context, making it easier to track activities and results.

Open the Expeditions module in the main menu: **Sampling → Expeditions**.

## Adding or editing an expedition

When creating or editing an expedition record, the following fields are available:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | Yes | Short name that describes and identifies the expedition (e.g., "Pantanal 2025") |
| **Start date** | Yes | First day of the expedition |
| **End date** | Yes | Last day of the expedition |
| **Project** |  | Project to which the expedition is linked (optional) |
| **Description** |  | Brief description of the expedition, including objectives, target species, or study area |

## Best practices

- **Use clear names**: Choose expedition names that are short but descriptive (region + year works well).  
- **Link to projects**: If the expedition is part of a larger research project, link it to ensure traceability.  
- **Record accurate dates**: Start and end dates are essential for organizing surveys and captures chronologically.  
- **Add descriptive notes**: Include objectives, target habitats, or logistical details in the description field.  
- **Group related surveys**: All surveys conducted during the expedition should be linked to it for consistency.  

## Relation to other modules

Expeditions are interconnected with several other parts of Xolmis:

- **[Surveys](surveys.md)**: Each survey can be linked to an expedition, grouping sampling events under a common field trip.  
- **[Captures](captures.md)**: Birds captured during an expedition are automatically associated with its surveys.  
- **[Projects](projects.md)**: Expeditions can be tied to specific projects, connecting fieldwork to broader research goals.  
- **[Permits](permits.md)**: Expeditions often require permits, which can be managed in the Permits module.  
- **[Reports](print-data.md)**: Expedition data can be summarized in reports, useful for funding agencies or institutional records.  

By managing expeditions in Xolmis, you create a structured framework for organizing fieldwork, ensuring that all surveys, captures, and observations are properly contextualized within the broader research effort.
