# Exporting data

One of the goals of Xolmis is to be a data repository, where you can select and transfer the data to use in other applications.

## Quick export

To use the quick export feature, [search and filter](search-and-filtering-data.md) the data as you see fit. Then click on the share :material-share: button. It will open the export dialog.

Select the file format to which you want to export on the left panel.

If the selected format has options, you could click the **Options** buttons to configure it. Here are the CSV options dialog:

Then select the columns that you want to export. When all is ready, click on the **Export** button. It will prompt for a filename and save the file using the defined settings.
