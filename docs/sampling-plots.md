# Sampling plots

A sampling plot represents a specific site of sampling which is regularly used, such as a trail, a mist net station, a tower or point of observation etc.

!!! note

    Toponyms and sampling plots are similar but not the same. Toponyms are well known named sites, while sampling plots are more specific sites generally "inside" a locality (toponym), and with names invented by the researcher. Also, a locality can have many sampling plots.
