# Introduction

## Why Xolmis?

Ornithological data are often collected in the field under challenging conditions and initially recorded manually on paper. Later, these records are digitized for analysis, but even then they are frequently stored in disparate formats such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or text documents, each with its own structure and conventions defined by individual researchers.

As a result, data may be scattered across multiple folders, devices, or even collaborators' computers. Locating specific information or remembering what exists can become a real challenge. Reusing data from different collections or projects often requires tedious **standardization, reformatting, and cleaning**. While collaborative science platforms do exist, a significant portion of valuable data remains siloed on personal machines, inaccessible to the broader scientific community.

**Xolmis** was created to address this fragmentation. It offers a unified solution for **collecting, organizing, curating, and managing ornithological data of various types**. Designed for researchers, field technicians, institutions, and conservation projects, Xolmis provides a centralized and structured environment that promotes:

- **Data consistency** – standardized formats across projects.
- **Traceability** – every change is logged and linked to a user.
- **Reuse** – datasets can be shared, exported, and integrated with other platforms.
- **Collaboration** – multiple users can work on the same database with defined roles and permissions.

## What is Xolmis?

Xolmis is an **integrated system for the collection and management of ornithological data**. It consolidates scattered datasets (spreadsheets, field notes, and digital records) into a coherent, searchable, and secure database.

Its main goals include:

- **Aggregating diverse data types** from research and field observations (captures, sightings, nests, specimens, permits, projects, etc.).
- **Facilitating data curation and validation**, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Cross-referencing records** across modules for richer ecological and biological insights.
- **Enabling data sharing and long-term preservation**, reducing the risk of data loss.
- **Increasing consistency, traceability, and security** in ornithological research workflows.

!!! info
    _Xolmis_ is a genus of Neotropical passerines. Today it is represented by two species: [_Xolmis irupero_](https://ebird.org/species/whimon1) and [_Xolmis velatus_](https://ebird.org/species/whrmon2). The name was chosen to symbolize the system’s focus on ornithology and its connection to Neotropical biodiversity.

## Applications

Xolmis is composed of two distinct applications, which can be used independently or together depending on the workflow:

- [**Xolmis Mobile**](xolmis-mobile.md):
  A lightweight field companion designed for **data collection in situ**. It allows researchers to record captures, sightings, and other observations directly on mobile devices, exporting them later in standardized formats (CSV or JSON).

- **Xolmis Desktop**:
  A full-featured application for **managing complex datasets**. It provides advanced tools for editing, verifying, importing, exporting, and analyzing ornithological data, as well as integration with external platforms like eBird.

Together, these applications create a seamless workflow: **collect in the field → consolidate in the database → analyze and share results**.

## Best practices when starting with Xolmis

- **Centralize your data**: Import scattered spreadsheets and notes into a single database.
- **Define user roles**: Assign permissions to collaborators to ensure accountability.
- **Use standardized modules**: Record data in the appropriate module (e.g., Captures, Nests, Sightings) for consistency.
- **Leverage mobile + desktop integration**: Collect data in the field with Xolmis Mobile and manage it later with Xolmis Desktop.
- **Plan for long-term preservation**: Configure backups and export datasets regularly to avoid data loss.

By adopting Xolmis, researchers and institutions gain a **robust, scalable, and collaborative platform** for ornithological data management, ensuring that valuable information is preserved, accessible, and ready to support conservation and scientific discovery.
