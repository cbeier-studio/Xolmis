# Introduction

## Why Xolmis?

Ornithological data are often collected in the field and recorded manually on paper. Later, these records are digitized for analysis, but even then, theyâ€™re frequently stored in disparate formats such as CSV files or Excel spreadsheets, each with its own structure and conventions defined by individual researchers.

These files may be scattered across multiple folders, devices, or even collaborators' computers. Locating specific data or remembering what exists can become a real challenge. Reusing data from different collections or projects often requires tedious standardization and reformatting. While collaborative science platforms do exist, a significant portion of valuable data remains siloed on personal machines.

**Xolmis** was created to address this fragmentation. It offers a unified solution for collecting, organizing, curating, and managing ornithological data of various types. Designed for researchers, field technicians, institutions, and conservation projects, Xolmis provides a centralized and structured environment that promotes data consistency, traceability, and reuse.

## What is Xolmis?

Xolmis is an integrated system for the collection and management of ornithological data. It helps consolidate scattered datasets, such as spreadsheets and field notes, into a coherent, searchable, and secure database.

Its goals include:

- Aggregating diverse data types from research and field observations.
- Facilitating data curation, validation, and cross-referencing.
- Enabling data sharing and long-term preservation.
- Increasing consistency, traceability, and security.

Xolmis is composed of two distinct applications:

- [**Xolmis Mobile**](https://github.com/cbeier-studio/xolmis_mobile): A lightweight field companion for data collection.
- **Xolmis Desktop**: A full-featured application for managing complex datasets.

Both can be used independently or together, depending on the workflow and environment.

!!! info

    _Xolmis_ is a genus of Neotropical passerines. Today it is represented by two species: [_Xolmis irupero_](https://ebird.org/species/whimon1) and [_Xolmis velatus_](https://ebird.org/species/whrmon2).
