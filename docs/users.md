# Users

A user is anyone who connects to and interacts with a Xolmis database file. Each database connection has its own set of users. To open a Xolmis connection, you must log in with a username and password. This username is recorded with any changes made to the data, providing both security and change tracking.

## User management dialog

To manage the database users, open it via main menu **File â†’ Manage users**. It opens a dialog with a list of users of the current database file, with a toolbar at the top.
